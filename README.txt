Running Environment:
   I have changed a lot of code from pp2 to pp3. 

   You will need flex, bison, and cmake to test the project.

   If you do not have these three on your machine, please run the following command:

   $ sudo apt install flex
   $ sudo apt install bison
   $ sudo apt install cmake

# compiler-homework-pp3
USE build.sh and exec.sh to build and run the project. 
Example: $ cd workdir How to build 
$ ./build.sh 

How to Run: 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad1.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad2.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad3.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad4.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad5.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/bad6.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/t1.decaf 
$./exec.sh ../sample/t2.decaf
$./exec.sh ../sample/t3.decaf
$./exec.sh ../sample/t4.decaf

I have passed all the cases on my machine. Please contact me, if you have any question.
